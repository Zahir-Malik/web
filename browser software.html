<h2>WHAT IS A BROWSER?</h2>
<img src="..\images\n1568064.gif"width="200" height="150"><br>
<br><h2>A web browser, or browser for short, is a computer software application that enables a person to locate, retrieve, and display content such as webpages, images, video, as well as other files on the World Wide Web<BR></h2>
<h2>Browsers work because every web page, image, and video on the web has its own unique Uniform Resource Locator (URL), allowing the browser to identify the resource and retrieve it from the web server.</br></h2>
<br>
<h1>What Is the Difference Between a Search Engine and a Browser?</h1>
<p><h2>Some people confuse web browsers and search engines, but they are not the same and perform different roles. A search engine is essentially a type of website that stores searchable information about other websites (common examples of search engines are Google, Bing, Yahoo, and Baidu). However, to connect to a website's server and display its webpages requires a browser. Some examples of browsers can be found below.<br></h2>
<br>
<h1><p align="center">POPULAR WEB BROWSERS</h1>
<h1>1. Google Chrome</h1>
<p><h3>Chrome, created by internet giant Google, is the most popular browser in the USA, perceived by its computer and smartphone users as fast, secure, and reliable. There are also many options for customization in the shape of useful extensions and apps that can be downloaded for free from the Chrome Store. Chrome also allows easy integration with other Google services, such as Gmail. Due to the success of the "Chrome" brand name, Google has now extended it to other products, for example, Chromebook, Chromebox, Chromecast, and Chrome OS.<br>

<h1>2. Apple Safari</h1><br>
<p><h3>Safari is the default on Apple computers and phones, as well as other Apple devices. It's generally considered to be an efficient browser, its slick design being in keeping with the ethos of Apple. Originally developed for Macs, Safari has become a significant force in the mobile market due to the domination of iPhones and iPads. Unlike some of the other browsers listed, Safari is exclusive to Apple, it doesn't run on Android devices, and the Windows version of Safari is no longer supported by important security updates from Apple.<br></h3>

<h1>3. Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge</h1>
<p><h3>Although it has been discontinued, Internet Explorer is worthy of mention as it was the go-to browser in the early days of the internet revolution, with usage share rising to 95% in 2003. However, its relatively slow start-up speed meant that many users turned to Chrome and Firefox in the years that followed. In 2015, Microsoft announced that Microsoft Edge would replace Internet Explorer as the default browser on Windows 10, making Internet Explorer 11 the final version to be released. At the time of writing, the market share of Microsoft Edge remains lower than Internet Explorer, which is still used by many people around the world</h3><br>

<h1>4. Mozilla Firefox</h1>
<p><h3>Unlike Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, and Microsoft Edge, Firefox is an open-source browser, created by community members of the Mozilla Foundation. It is perhaps the most customizable of the main browsers, with many add-ons and extensions to choose from. In late 2003, it had a usage share of 32.21% before gradually losing out to competition from Google Chrome. It currently remains a strong competitor in the "desktop" field but has a lower market share in the mobile arena, where Google Chrome and Apple Safari tend to dominate.<br></h3>

<h1>5.Opera  Mini</h1>
<p><h3>Opera Mini is a mobile web browser developed by Opera Software AS. It was primarily designed for the Java ME platform, as a low-end sibling for Opera Mobile, but it is now developed exclusively for Android. It was previously developed for Windows 10 Mobile, Windows Phone 8.1, BlackBerry, Symbian, and Bada. As of 2018, the Android build is the only version still under active development<br>Opera Mini was derived from the Opera web browser. Opera Mini requests web pages through Opera Software's compression proxy server. The compression server processes and compresses requested web pages before sending them to the mobile phone. The compression ratio is 90% and the transfer speed is increased by two to three times as a result. The pre-processing increases compatibility with web pages not designed for mobile phones. However, interactive sites which depend upon the device processing JavaScript do not work properly<br>
