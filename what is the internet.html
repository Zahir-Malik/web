<h1> <FONT COLOR="BLUE">WHAT IS AN INTERNET?...</H1></FONT>
<h3>The internet is the wider network that allows computer networks around the world run by companies, governments, universities and other organizations to talk to one another. The result is a mass of cables, computers, data centers, routers, servers, repeaters, satellites and Wi-Fi towers that allows digital information to travel around the world.
It is that infrastructure that lets you order the weekly shop, share your life on Facebook, stream Outcast on Netflix, email your aunt in Wollongong and search the web for the world's tiniest cat.

<h2><font color="6a9cda">HOW BIG THIS INTERNET</font></H2>
<p><h3><font color="272620"><font family="calibri body">One measure is the amount of information that courses through it: about five Exabyte's a day. That's equivalent to 40,000 two-hour standard definition movies per second.
It takes some wiring up. Hundreds of thousands of miles of cables criss-cross countries, and more are laid along sea floors to connect islands and continents. About 300 submarine cables, the deep-sea variant only as thick as a garden hose, underpin the modern internet. Most are bundles of hair-thin fibre optics that carry data at the speed of light.</font></h3>
