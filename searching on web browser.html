<h1>Web Searching</h1>
<h2>The most productive way to conduct a search on the internet is through a search engine. A web search engine is a software system designed to search for information on the World Wide Web. The search results are generally presented in a line of results often referred to as search engine results pages (SEROs). The information may be a mix of web pages, images, and other types of files. Some search engines also mine data available in databases or open directories.<br>
<h2>There are a number of various search engines available and some of them may seem familiar to you<br>
          <ul>
		  <li>The top web search engines are Google, Bing, Yahoo, Ask.com, and AOL.com</li><br>
		  <li>For the purpose of this course, we will be searching using the Google Chrome web browser, and search first with the Google search engine and then Microsoft's Bing search engine.</li>
		  </ul>

		  <h1>Searching on Chrome</h1>
<h2>Your supervisor at Rowan Retail asked you to find out what the most popular kids toys are this year. He wants to have those toys stocked in the store for the upcoming holiday season. In order for you to find out that information, you turn on a computer and get ready to conduct a search on the internet</h2>
<h2>The first step is to open a Chrome browser by clicking on the desktop icon or the icon on the computer desktopâ€™s taskbar. Once the browser window is open, type www.google.com into the address bar on the top of the browser window and press the Enter (or Return) key on the keyboard</h2><br>

<br>
<h2>The browser now displays the large Google search bar. As you begin to enter the phrase most popular toys of 2017 into the search bar, notice how the search bar moves to the top of the screen as the words are typed. This movement is normal; continue to type the phrase</h2><BR>
<IMG SRC="..\images\Screenshot (201).png"><BR>
<H2>As the words are typed, the search engine will display a dropdown list of suggested search options. At this point either continue typing the phrase or select the option of most popular toys 2017. Selecting a suggestion option is done in two ways; either by using the mouse to click on the desired option, or by using the down arrow key on the keyboard to select an option, then pushing the Enter (or Return) key</H2>

<h2>The search is now entered and the webpage displays the results of your search. Notice how the results are displayed. Box #1 is the first page of the search results. Box #2 is an advertisement targeted to be relevant to the search. The search results in the list are titled by hyperlinks in a larger font and in a blue color. These links direct you to a website with information about the search. The advertisements on the right side are linked to something to buy. When conducting a search for information, the primary focus is on the list of search results, not the advertisements.</h2><br>
