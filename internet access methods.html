<uL>
<li>LEASED CIRCUITS</li>
<li>DIAL-UP ACCESS</li>
<li> WIRELESS ACCESS METHODS</li>
</ul>
<h2>LEASED CIRCUITS</h2>
<ul><h3>
<li>A least line is a private telecommunications circuits between two or more locations provided according to a commercial contract</li>
<li>It is sometimes also known as a private circuit, and as a data line in the UK</li>
<li>These are used by business to connect geographically distant offices </li>
</ul></h3>

<h1>Types of Leased Line</h1>

<ul><h2>
<li>Point to point connection
</li>
<li>Multiple protocol level switching(MPLS)VPN</li>
<li> Internet Leased Line</li>

<br>
<h1>DIAL UP ACCESS</h1>
<ul><h2>
<li> This is a  connection just like a phone</li>
<li> It uses analog telephone lines </li>
<li>Connection through modem  and a public telephone network.</li>
<li>Using a dial-up line to transmit data is similar to using the telephone to make a call</li>
<li> Speed is 56kbps </li>
</ul></h2>

<h1>PROCESS OF DIAL-UP</h1>
<Ol><h2>
<li> The client computer modem dials the preprogrammed phone number</li>
<li> Verification of userâ€™s account by IPS </li>
<li>Connection is established and data can be transmitted.</li>
<li>When either modem hangs up the communication ends.</li>

<ul><h2>BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS</ul>
<li><h2>In telecommunications, broadband is wide bandwidth transport multiple signals and traffic types. The medium can be coaxial cable , optical fiber, radio or twisted pair.</li><br>
<li><h2> in the context of internet access , broadband is used to mean any high-speed internet access that is always on and faster than dial-up access over traditional analog or ISDN PSTN services  </li><br>
</ul></h2>

<h1>WHY WE NEED BROADBAND SERVICES</h1>
<img src="C:\Users\Sameera\Desktop\internet\images\n1538698.gif">

<h2>Eliminates long waiting periods while data is transferred</h2>
<h2>Makes work related tasks similar to takes at office via LAN</h2>
<h2>Moving large documents via e-mail FLP ,and other means quickly</h2>
<h2>Online gaming is more immersive experience and more realistic</h2>
<br>
<h1><ul>BROADBAND TYPES</h1>
<li><h2>Digital  Subscriber Line(DSL)</h2></li>
<li><h2> Cable modems</h2> </li>
<li><h2>Wireless </h2></li>
<li><h2>satellite</h2> </li>
</ul>
<H1><p align="center">WIRELESS ACCESS METHODS</h1>
<h2> Wireless is the tern use to describe telecommunication in which electro magnetic waves ,such as radio waves ,micro waves ,infrared and laser beam carry the data over part or all of the communication path </h2>
<h2>A wireless network is a computer network that uses wireless data connections between network nodes</h2>
<br>
<h2><font color="blue">ADVANTAGES</h2>
<h3>The speed of wireless is very reliable and steady<br>
The response of wireless services is very  good :there is a very little latency 
Initial equipment costs and installation van be high , but recovered over 2-3 year contract</h3>
<br>
<h2>DIADVANTAGES</h2>
<h3>Direct line of sight is required between antenna for fixed wireless to function: trees and foliage are major obstacles to wireless signal <br>
Shared access of fixed wireless could be potential bottleneck; ISP (Weather can  sometime disrupt service or damage equipment</h3>
<br>
<h1><p align="center"><font color="7b6d6a">WIRELESS ACCESS METHOD</h1>
<h1><ul>SATELLITE CONNECTION</h1>
<font size="5"><li>Internet access provided through satellite</li>
<li>Data is being sent from the satellite to a user's equipment and then translated and decoded</li>
<li>Delivered through satellite dish</li>
<li>Upload speed-128kbps</li>
<li>Download speed-400kbps</li>
<li>Satellite internet provides has a FAP(Fair Access Policy)</li>
</ul></h3>

<h1><ul>WI-FI(Wireless Fidelity)</h1>
<font size="5"><li>Big internet buzz word & growing very rapidly</li>
<li>Vic Hayes has been named as father of WI-FI</li>
<li>Usually requires the ISP to invest a bit in transceivers</li>
<li>At least 7 or more end users can be sharing the same master transceiver & still each be able to get up to 1544kbps</li>
<li>Practical  range is about 90 meters(300 feet) from the transceivers using normal powered transmitters </li>
</ul></h3>

<h2>ADVANTAGES AND DIADVANTAGES OF WI-FI</h2>
<ul><font color="black"><u>ADVANTAGES </u></font>
<li>Password and security</li>
<li> Eliminate re-configuring computers </li>
<li> Avoid deterioration with time</li>
<li> Flexible working</li>
</ul>

<ul><font color="black"><u>DISADVANTAGES </u></font>
<li>Signal strength sensitivity</li>
<li> Climatic conditions </li>
</ul>

<h1><ul>WLAN</h1>
<font size="5"><li>Wireless Local Area Network </li>
<li>Provide wireless network communication over short distances</li>
<li>Users radio or infrared signals instead of traditional network cabling</li>
<li>Built by attaching a device called the access point</li>
<li>IEEE 802.11 is the foremost standards for wireless LANs </li>
