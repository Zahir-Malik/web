<h1><p align="center"><font color="154d79">HISTORY OF THE INTERNET</h1><br>

<p><h3>The Internet has revolutionized the computer and communications world like nothing before. The invention of the telegraph, telephone, radio, and computer set the stage for this unprecedented integration of capabilities. The Internet is at once a world-wide broadcasting capability, a mechanism for information dissemination, and a medium for collaboration and interaction between individuals and their computers without regard for geographic location. The Internet represents one of the most successful examples of the benefits of sustained investment and commitment to research and development of information infrastructure. Beginning with the early research in packet switching, the government, industry and academia have been partners in evolving and deploying this exciting new technology. Today, terms like "bleiner@computer.org" and "http://www.acm.org" trip lightly off the tongue of the random person on the street</h3><br>

<h1>WHO INVENTED THE INTERNET?</h1>

<p><h3>As you might expect for a technology so expansive and ever-changing, it is impossible to credit the invention of the internet to a single person. The internet was the work of dozens of pioneering scientists, programmers and engineers who each developed new features and technologies that eventually merged to become the "information superhighway" we know today.<br>
<br>Long before the technology existed to actually build the internet, many scientists had already anticipated the existence of worldwide networks of information. Nikola Tesla toyed with the idea of a "world wireless system" in the early 1900s, and visionary thinkers like Paul Otlet and Vannevar Bushconceived of mechanized, searchable storage systems of books and media in the 1930s and 1940s. <br>
<br>Still, the first practical schematics for the internet would not arrive until the early 1960s, when MIT's J.C.R. Licklider popularized the idea of an "Intergalactic Network" of computers. Shortly thereafter, computer scientists developed the concept of "packet switching," a method for effectively transmitting electronic data that would later become one of the major building blocks of the internet<br>
<br>The first workable prototype of the Internet came in the late 1960s with the creation of ARPANET, or the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network. Originally funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, ARPANET used packet switching to allow multiple computers to communicate on a single network.<br>
<br>On October 29, 1969, ARPAnet delivered its first message: a "node-to-node" communication from one computer to another. (The first computer was located in a research lab at UCLA and the second was at Stanford; each one was the size of a small house.) The message-"LOGIN"-was short and simple, but it crashed the fledgling ARPA network anyway: The Stanford computer only received the note's first two letters<br>
<br>The technology continued to grow in the 1970s after scientists Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf developed Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol, or TCP/IP, a communications model that set standards for how data could be transmitted between multiple networks. <br>
<br>ARPANET adopted TCP/IP on January 1, 1983, and from there researchers began to assemble the "network of networks" that became the modern Internet. The online world then took on a more recognizable form in 1990, when computer scientist<b> Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web.</b> While itâ€™s often confused with the internet itself, the web is actually just the most common means of accessing data online in the form of websites and hyperlinks. <br>
